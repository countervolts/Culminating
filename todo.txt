Finished features:

[add] impliemnt func that will create a file and show the user their stats about the game
[add/fix] comments


Partially/Mostly finished features:

[add] output when the user dies that will show the following
    - score (implement score system) [todo idk]
    - time played
    - number of moves
    - number of levels completed

[debug] make it more organized
    - just the auto move debug_log (everything else is good)


Todo:

[add] make the game get harder as the levels go on
    - make enemy move faster (reduce the time between enemy moves)
    - make maze bigger (increase WIDTH HEIGHT every level or 2)
    - [?] implement diffculty scale in settings.py

[add] easy way the change settings that isnt in the settings.py
[add] something to show the user between levels (possible ive already made the end game stats logging)
[add] show game details before game starts (i forget what i mean by this tbh)


[fix] the user not being able to go to the next level when completing the current level
    - how to replicate the issue: walk to the yellow dot and it wont let them finish
    - when in auto move it will allow them to go to the next level

[fix] line 317 with player noclip being buggy when walking into walls
